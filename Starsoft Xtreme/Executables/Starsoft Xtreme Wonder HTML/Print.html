By the time your done you will have a whole new grasp on computers and how they work. Keep in mind, if you've read other texts by Boomer, that this is written the same way, same format and so forth....<BR><BR>Who can read this? Who can read this text, your probably asking yourself right now. This text is intended for any average computer owner who is willing to expand his/her horizon on how the internet works and how computers work. <BR><BR>I'm expecting that you already know how to work your way around windows and a FEW computer terms.<BR><BR>Disclaimer: This text is for educational purposes only and i strongly recommend that you do not use the info provided for illigal or evil things.<BR><BR>Let's Get Started: If your reading this I take it that you are looking for help on your computer or you want to learn how to use a PC like a pro. Well this text will not tell you how to use it like a pro, but i can give you some guidance and help you start your journey to become a "Hacker". I put "hacker" in quotes because anybody can be called a "hacker" depending on their perception. Personally, I never use the term "hacker" because it can be used frivolously. To me, you can't spell hacker without "Programmer", get it? <BR><BR>Now familiarize yourself with the term "Lamer". There is no such term and if someone calls you a little lamer on the internet or whatnot, they are just trying to piss you off and have nothing better to do then make fun of you. The best thing to do on the internet if someone makes fun of you or calls you a lamer is to just put them on ignore or just overall ignore them. <BR><BR>If you plan on becomming a "hacker" then the first and formost thing is to THINK like one, dont be one of these malicious ones that go about nuking people and handing out trojans, viruses and what not, you know? Those are what you call "Lamers". <BR><BR>I strongly recommend that you get to know DOS. This text is not going to tell you how to use DOS but you can check out the COM files in the windows directory and learn what they do. the most basic commands are netstat, ping, net view, telnet and ftp. If you use those properly, they can be to your advantage. just if your curious and your wondering what DOS commands can be harmful and only most computer technicians use are debug(my fav ;-)), d40:0(once in debug mode), ctty, rescue(deadly, do not use) and deltree. <BR><BR>Study those basic commands i gave above and you should be on your first step towards "hacking". if you want other texts that are strictly for doing stuff like that, email me at boomer995@hotmail.com and i'll give you some if you ask. <BR><BR>Another thing you should learn is when to walk away from a fight and how to walk away from a fight. When should you walk away from your average Nuker or Trojan User? As soon as he gives you some sorta indication that hes using his trojan client on your machine and do so by saving the hostle history that he has sent you and then just disconnecting. <BR><BR>Alright, enough with this crap, let's get down to some serious business. hehehe. If you are serious about learning computers and such, buy the books DOS For Dummies 3rd Edition. nothing below 3rd edition, below 3rd its just baby basic crap that is irrelevant even DOS 3rd is kinda basic but ANYWAYS. I also suggest you get some books that teach you advanced training in windows. Don't laugh... they are fairly well written and dont tell you how to click and drag... they tell you how to edit protocols and set up proxys... yeah.. NOW who's laughing. :-)<BR></FONT></BODY></HTML>
